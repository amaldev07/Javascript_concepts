Js Engine Exposed: -

I am trying to understand how the js engine works
lets take google v8 engine for reference
i understand the code first parse and make the abstract sysntax tree
then it goes to interpreter and compiler befre executing
how this interpreter and compiler works
what are the exactly doing 
----------------------------
Ans:- 
In the Google V8 engine, JavaScript code is processed in multiple stages before it gets executed. The interpreter and compiler work together in a system known as "Just-In-Time" (JIT) compilation. Here’s a more detailed look at how they function:

1. Parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation
The JavaScript code is first parsed into tokens and then transformed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This AST represents the structure of the code in a tree format, where each node corresponds to language constructs (variables, functions, expressions, etc.).
2. Ignition: The Interpreter
The V8 engine uses Ignition as its interpreter. The interpreter processes the AST and generates bytecode, which is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of the code. The interpreter’s role is to:

Quickly execute the code: Ignition starts executing the bytecode immediately, which allows for faster startup times.
Collect profiling data: While running, Ignition monitors how often certain parts of the code are executed. It keeps track of frequently executed functions (hot code) to help guide optimization decisions.
The interpreter doesn’t focus on making the code super optimized—it prioritizes quick execution and gathers data to hand off to the optimizing compiler.

3. Turbofan: The Optimizing Compiler
V8 uses Turbofan as its optimizing compiler. When certain parts of the code are identified as "hot" (frequently executed), the interpreter passes the profiling data to Turbofan, which can:

Generate optimized machine code: Turbofan compiles the bytecode into highly efficient machine code, specific to the platform (e.g., x86 or ARM). This is JIT compilation in action, happening while the program runs.
Perform type inlining and other optimizations: The compiler makes aggressive assumptions based on the types of data being used (like assuming a variable will always be an integer) to make the code run faster. It can inline functions, remove redundant operations, and more.
4. Deoptimization
If the assumptions made by the compiler turn out to be incorrect (for example, if a variable that was expected to always be an integer turns out to be a string), V8 can "deoptimize" the code and return to running it in the interpreter. This prevents crashes and ensures correctness at the cost of some performance.

Summary of Their Roles:
Interpreter (Ignition): Translates AST into bytecode, executes it quickly, and collects runtime information for optimization.
Compiler (Turbofan): Takes frequently used code (hot code) and compiles it into optimized machine code for faster execution.
This process of interpreting, optimizing, and sometimes deoptimizing helps strike a balance between fast startup and efficient long-term execution.
