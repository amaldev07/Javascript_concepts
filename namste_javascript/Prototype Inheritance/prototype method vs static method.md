is prototype methods are same as static methods
--------------------
No, prototype methods and static methods are not the same. They differ in how they are accessed, where they are defined, and their purpose in the context of object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

Key Differences Between Prototype Methods and Static Methods

| Feature                        | Prototype Methods                                 | Static Methods                                    |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                 | Defined on the prototype of the constructor function (`Constructor.prototype.methodName`) | Defined directly on the constructor function itself (`Constructor.methodName`) |
| **Accessed By**                | Accessed via instances of the constructor (e.g., `instance.methodName()`) | Accessed via the constructor function directly (e.g., `Constructor.methodName()`) |
| **Usage**                      | Used to define behavior shared by all instances of a class or constructor function. | Used for utility or helper functions that are relevant to the class or constructor but not tied to a particular instance. |
| **Inheritance**                | Methods are inherited by all instances created using the constructor function or class. | Not inherited by instances. Available only on the constructor function. |
| **`this` Context**             | `this` refers to the instance calling the method. | `this` refers to the class or constructor function itself. |
| **Purpose**                    | To define instance-specific behavior or shared behavior between instances. | To define class-level functionality or helper methods. |
| **Memory Usage**               | Memory-efficient as they are shared via the prototype chain. | Independent of instances, so no impact on instance memory. |
| **Example**                    | `Person.prototype.sayHello = function() { ... }`  | `Person.sayHello = function() { ... }`            |



Example of Prototype Method vs Static Method
Let's see these differences in practice:

javascript
Copy code
// Define a constructor function named Person
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

// Define a prototype method (available on instances of Person)
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
};

// Define a static method (available on Person itself, not on instances)
Person.describe = function() {
    console.log("This is a Person class used to create people with name and age.");
};

// Create an instance of Person
let person1 = new Person('Alice', 25);

// Call the prototype method on the instance
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.

// Call the static method on the Person constructor
Person.describe(); // Output: This is a Person class used to create people with name and age.

// Trying to call the static method on the instance will result in an error
person1.describe(); // Error: person1.describe is not a function
Detailed Explanation
Prototype Method:

Person.prototype.greet is a prototype method.
It is defined on Person.prototype and is shared by all instances of Person.
You can access it through any Person instance, such as person1.greet().
this inside greet refers to the instance that calls the method (e.g., person1 in this case).
Static Method:

Person.describe is a static method.
It is defined directly on the Person constructor function, not on its prototype.
It cannot be called by instances of Person (e.g., person1.describe() would result in an error).
Static methods are typically used for utility functions or operations that don’t depend on an instance’s properties. For example, you might use a static method to create or process instances.
Static Methods in ES6 Classes
The difference between prototype methods and static methods is even clearer in ES6 classes, where static is a specific keyword used to define static methods.

    class Person {
        constructor(name, age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        // Prototype method
        greet() {
            console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
        }

        // Static method
        static describe() {
            console.log("This is a Person class used to create people with name and age.");
        }
    }

// Create an instance of Person
let person1 = new Person('Alice', 25);

// Call the prototype method on the instance
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.

// Call the static method on the Person class
Person.describe(); // Output: This is a Person class used to create people with name and age.

// Trying to call the static method on the instance will result in an error
person1.describe(); // Error: person1.describe is not a function
Key Points to Remember
Prototype Methods:

Defined on the prototype object of the constructor function or class.
Accessible through instances of the constructor or class.
Useful for methods that operate on individual instance properties or shared logic between instances.
Static Methods:

Defined directly on the constructor function or class using the static keyword (in ES6 classes) or direct assignment (in constructor functions).
Accessible only through the constructor function or class itself, not through instances.
Useful for utility methods, factory methods, or methods that don’t rely on instance properties.
When to Use Which?
Use Prototype Methods When:

You want to define methods that operate on instance-specific data or need to be shared across all instances of the same class.
Use Static Methods When:

You need functionality that is related to the class itself, not any specific instance.
Examples include utility methods, factory methods to create instances, or helper methods like calculating a maximum value, processing multiple instances, etc.

Visual Representation
// For prototype methods:
Person
  ├── prototype
  │     ├── greet: function() {...}
  │     └── __proto__ (links to Object.prototype)
  └── describe: function() {...}  (static method on the constructor)

// For static methods:
Person.prototype
  └── greet: function() {...}
Person
  └── describe: function() {...}  (static method on the class)
