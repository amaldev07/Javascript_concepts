I am trying to understand clausers in javascript
In the above code

here on let c2 =  outer();
where it starts from count 0
not from count 2
why

The behavior you’re seeing in your code is due to how closures work in JavaScript. Let me walk you through it step-by-step to clarify:

Key Concept of Closures:
A closure is formed when an inner function (in your case, increment) captures variables from the outer function’s scope (count from outer). Even after the outer function has finished executing, the inner function retains access to the variables it captured.

Now, let’s break down your code:

Code Execution Walkthrough
When outer() is called:

A new execution context is created for the outer function.
A new variable count is initialized with 0 inside this context.
The increment function is defined, which references the count variable from its enclosing scope (the outer function).
The outer function returns the increment function, and this returned function is stored in the variable c1.
First c1() call:

The increment function is called. Since it still holds the reference to the count variable from the previous outer call, it increments it from 0 to 1.
Output: 1
Second c1() call:

The same increment function is called again. It still has access to the same count variable, which was previously 1. So it increments it to 2.
Output: 2
When outer() is called again and assigned to c2:

A new execution context for outer is created, and a new count variable is initialized to 0.
This new instance of increment now closes over this new count variable.
This is why, when c2() is called, it starts from 0 again — it's working with a different count variable from a separate closure.
Calling c2() multiple times:

Each call to c2() will increment the count that belongs to the second outer invocation. This count is distinct from the one used by c1.
Why does c2() start from 0 and not 2?
Each time outer() is called, a new closure is created, with its own separate variables. The count variable inside the closure returned by c1 is independent from the count variable inside the closure returned by c2. They do not share state. Thus, when c2() is called, it starts from 0 because the count variable belongs to a fresh new invocation of outer().

Visualization of Scope and Closures:

Copy code
c1 --> increment() --> count = 2 (closure #1)
c2 --> increment() --> count = 2 (closure #1
