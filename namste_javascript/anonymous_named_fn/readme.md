In JavaScript, named function expressions like the one in your example behave a bit differently from regular function declarations. Here's what's happening in your code:

let a = function abc() {
  console.log("Hii");
}

Key Points:
Named Function Expression:

The function is assigned to the variable a, but the function itself has a name abc.
The name abc is only accessible inside the function, for recursion or self-referencing, but it is not available outside the function.
Scope of the Function Name:

The name abc is local to the function body, so you cannot access abc outside the function.
When you try to call abc() outside, JavaScript throws the error Uncaught ReferenceError: abc is not defined because abc is not defined in the outer scope.
Solution:
You can call the function using the variable a, as that is where the function is stored:

a(); // This will log "Hii"
If you want to use the function name externally, you should use a function declaration instead:

function abc() {
  console.log("Hii");
}

abc(); // This will work and log "Hii"
So, in your case, to avoid the error, either call a() or change the function to a declaration if you want to call abc() directly.
