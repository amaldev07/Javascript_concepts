i am trying to unsdertsnad indepth knowledge in anonymous named functions in javascript
let a = function abc(){
console.log("Hii");
}
when i call abc()
i am getting error
anonymous_named_function.js:5 Uncaught ReferenceError: abc is not defined
Why

In JavaScript, named function expressions like the one in your example behave a bit differently from regular function declarations. Here's what's happening in your code:

let a = function abc() {
  console.log("Hii");
}

Key Points:
Named Function Expression:

The function is assigned to the variable a, but the function itself has a name abc.
The name abc is only accessible inside the function, for recursion or self-referencing, but it is not available outside the function.
Scope of the Function Name:

The name abc is local to the function body, so you cannot access abc outside the function.
When you try to call abc() outside, JavaScript throws the error Uncaught ReferenceError: abc is not defined because abc is not defined in the outer scope.
Solution:
You can call the function using the variable a, as that is where the function is stored:

a(); // This will log "Hii"
If you want to use the function name externally, you should use a function declaration instead:

function abc() {
  console.log("Hii");
}

abc(); // This will work and log "Hii"
So, in your case, to avoid the error, either call a() or change the function to a declaration if you want to call abc() directly.

Q) as per the above descriptin i was debugging the local scope in chrome dev tools
i am not able to see abc in local scope
then i added line  let x = abc; inside abc()
then i can see abc in local scope
why so

That's an excellent observation! Here's a detailed explanation of what's happening:

Why You Don't See abc in the Local Scope Initially
In JavaScript, a named function expression (like function abc() {} inside let a = function abc() {}) makes the name (abc) available only within the function's own scope. However, Chrome DevTools might not always show the name abc in the local scope if it hasn't been referenced inside the function body. The JavaScript engine might optimize out unused variables, and since abc is not being used, it doesn't appear in the local scope during debugging.

Why You See abc After Adding let x = abc
When you add let x = abc; inside the function body, you're making a reference to abc within its own scope. Now, because abc is being used inside the function, it becomes visible in the local scope during debugging.

Here's a breakdown of why:

let a = function abc() {
  let x = abc; // Now 'abc' is referenced, so it's available in the local scope
  console.log("Hii");
}

When abc is referenced inside the function (with let x = abc;), the JavaScript engine keeps it available in the local scope for debugging and execution.
Without this reference, the engine optimizes it away since it's not being used, so it's not shown in the local scope during debugging.

Summary:-
Named function expressions create a name (e.g., abc) that's accessible only within the function itself.
Chrome DevTools will only show abc in the local scope if it's being used inside the function body.
Adding let x = abc; forces abc to be referenced, making it visible in the local scope.
This is due to how JavaScript engines optimize variable handling for better performance. If a variable is not being referenced, it's likely to be excluded from the displayed local scope to reduce memory overhead.
